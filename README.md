Trick and Treat is a 2D Sidescrolling Beat-em-Up set in Suburbia during Halloween. It stars Tom, a delusional Ghostbuster who seeks to rid the world of “ghosts” by stealing their “ectoplasm” with his trusty  Ghost Catchifier. He must avoid avoid vengeful parents and zealous Neighborhood Watch as he does his best to survive the night. The game targets the classic arcade goer and people who have fond memories of fun side scrolling beat em ups.
